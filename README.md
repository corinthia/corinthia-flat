# Flat

Part of the [Corinthia](http://corinthia.io) project.

Flat (Formal LAanguage Transformation) is an experimental programming language
for parsing, transforming, and pretty-printing any data format that can be
expressed as a [Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG)] [1].

Its purpose is to provide an easy way of dealing with file formats like
Markdown, LaTeX, and org-mode which use a custom grammar, rather than a
standardized meta-format like XML or JSON.

Initially, the intention is to simply provide a parser interpreter (similar to a
parser generator of the bison/flex variety) such that we can get an abstract
syntax tree from a file, from which further processing can be done. The plan is
to later extend it to include a domain-specific language for expressing
transformations between different grammars, similar to [Stratego/XT] [2].

To understand PEGs, read the following papers:
